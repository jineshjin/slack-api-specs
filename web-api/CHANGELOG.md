# Web API specifications changelog

#### July 2019

We've finally made some updates after a long dormant period. Thanks for bearing with us.

Our specifications are programmatically generated from a collection of internal metadata and JSON Schema. As schemas improve or made more correct, the OpenAPI spec evolves. We try to incorporate reported issues in each release.

* Brought OpenAPI 2.0 specification up to date with most of our internal metadata and JSON schema systems.
    - Because OpenAPI 2.0 uses a _subset_ (and sometimes a _superset_) of JSON Schema, some schema definitions are modified in translation and not as expressive as reality. In particular, expressing the `oneOf` instruction is difficult and we replace this nuance with the generic `items`.
    - Many of our schemas are improved and no longer require copious use of `additionalProperties` to be described.
* Removed [`rtm.start`](https://api.slack.com/methods/rtm.start) from the method catalog. Its response varies and we strongly recommend developers to use [`rtm.connect`](https://api.slack.com/methods/rtm.connect) instead.
* Removed some of the `search.*` methods from the catalog due to varied responses that cannot yet pass validation. We'll add these back in the next release.
* Added a bare bones `definitions/blocks` schema. We'd like to provide finer grained schema for [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) in the future.
* 132 methods now have well-defined response schema.
